1.Use Matlab command “load patients” to load patient self evaluation dataset.2.If you use other programming languages or tools, save the data to a file so your tool can read.3.Use variables Age, Gender, Height, Weight, Smoker, Location, SelfAssessedHealthStatus to build a linear regression model to predict the systolic blood pressure.4.Use **lasso regression** with **10-fold cross-validation** to identify useful predictors. Plot a lasso plot with readable tick labels on the X and Y coordinates in your plot for easy visualization and verification. Missing clear and readable tick labels in your plot will cost you significant points for this assignment.5.Which top **TWO** predictors are you going to select after the lasso analysis?6.What is the lambda (l) value you choose in order to select the top two predictors you identified in the last question?7.What are the q values for the two selected predictors at the lambda (l) value you identified in the last question?
